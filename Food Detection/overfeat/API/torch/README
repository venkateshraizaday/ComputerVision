REQUIREMENTS:

torch
overfeat
ccmake

INSTALLATION:

mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..

Please set the variable OVERFEAT_ROOT to a folder containing liboverfeat.a
And check the variables CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and Torch_DIR
Generate and run :

make
make install

For some reason, sometimes torch doesn't install liboverfeat_torch.so at
the right path. If torch cannot find this file, you can simply copy it
from the build directory to ${Torch_DIR}/lib/torch/lua (or to your
working directory).

USAGE:

In torch, import overfeat with
require 'overfeat_torch'

Then you have the same function as in C++ (see overfeat README) :
- init(path_to_weight_file)
- free()
- fprop(input [,output])   output can be passed to avoid reallocating
- get_output(i [, output])
- get_n_layers()
- get_class_name(i)
