INSTALL:
	python setup.py install

USAGE:
	The following functions are available. See the main README, in the C++ API
	section, for their meaning :
		 - init
		 - free
		 - fprop
		 - get_n_layers
		 - get_output
		 - get_class_name

	All these functions use numpy.ndarray, with dtype=numpy.float32.
	Please remember overfeat puts the channels first, meaning that the
	expected input in fprop should have size 3xHxW (RGB image of size HxW),
	although numpy loads images with size HxWx3, so it must be transposed.
	See sample.py for an example.
